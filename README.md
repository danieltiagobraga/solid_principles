# Description
This project revises each SOLID Principles in C#

# What is SOLID?
SOLID are five basic principles which help to create good software architecture. 

SOLID is an acronym where:
* S stands for SRP (Single responsibility principle)
* O stands for OCP (Open closed principle)
* L stands for LSP (Liskov substitution principle)
* I stands for ISP (Interface segregation principle)
* D stands for DIP (Dependency inversion principle)

The idea is that, by applying those principles together, you can write better quality code.
